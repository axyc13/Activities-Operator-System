# Activities Operator System

This was my submission for the SOFTENG281 Assignment 1. It is coded entirely in Java, using OOP :)

The operator system is 100% terminal-driven and functions much like review websites such as 'TripAdvisor.' 

You may add activities/attractions that are in the given cities around New Zealand. 

From there, you may add/remove reviews as well as endorse locations personally, anonymously, or as a professional

Enjoy!
